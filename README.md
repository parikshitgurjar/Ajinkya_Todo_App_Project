# Project : React Todo with Local Storage

Project Link : https://parikshitgurjar.github.io/Ajinkya_Todo_App_Project/

#### This is a simple Todo application built using React Hooks and Local Storage. The application allows users to create, manage, and persist their todo lists in the browser's local storage.

## Features : 
- Add Todo: Users can add new tasks to the todo list by typing in the input field and clicking the "+" button.

- Mark as Completed: Each todo item has a checkbox that users can check to mark the task as completed. Completed tasks will have a strike-through effect on their text.

- Edit Todo: Users can edit existing tasks by clicking on the "Edit" icon next to the task. This opens an edit form where users can update the task's title.

- Delete Todo: Users can remove individual tasks by clicking on the "Trash" icon next to the task.

- Delete All Todos: The application provides a "DELETE ALL" button that allows users to remove all the tasks from the list at once.

- Local Storage: The application uses local storage to store the todo list data, ensuring that the todos persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
